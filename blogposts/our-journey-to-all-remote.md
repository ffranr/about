On February 20, 2020 we officially moved out of our amazing San Francisco office and became an [all-remote](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/remote) company. Many people have not worked at an all-remote company before and I frequently get questions, especially from candidates, about what led to this decision, so this blog post documents our journey to all-remote.

## Remote friendly engineering

For most of Sourcegraph's history we have had an office in San Francisco, but many of our early engineering hires were distributed across the world so we have had remote-friendly practices ingrained in our culture from the very beginning. As a result, we strongly value things like asynchronous written communication, personal responsibility, and autonomy; nothing else works when your teammates are in different timezones.

## Distributed days

Since we were open to hiring engineers from all over the world, our engineering team organically grew to be more distributed over time. Continuing to be a remote-friendly place to work was important for us as we grew the team. In late 2018 we started experimenting with scheduled days where SF teammates were encouraged to work from a location other than the office; we called these "distributed days".

This experiment had two goals:

1. Give SF teammates dedicated heads downtime to optimize productivity (e.g., fewer interruptions, skip your commute).
2. Generate more empathy for distributed teammates by having SF teammates solely rely on written communication and video chat instead of in-person conversations.

After doing this a few times, we surveyed the team to see what everyone had learned. Here is a summary of the feedback that we collected from the team in early 2019:

- Empathy
    - Don’t be late for a video chat.
    - Write down meeting notes so anyone who wasn't able to attend can catch up and participate in the conversation moving forward.
    - Have discussions and document decisions in public Slack channels or GitHub issues.
    - Use headphones for video calls to avoid echo.
- Productivity
    - Some people were more productive due to increased focus time and time saved not commuting.
    - Others were less productive because their best work setup (e.g., external monitors, nice desk, nice chair) was at the office.
- Conclusions
    - We don't need to continue having coordinated distributed days to achieve productivity. If individual teammates want to periodically work from a different location to be productive, they should do so.
    - Distributed best practices should be documented and practiced as part of our culture.

## Remote-first

In the middle of 2019, we decided to more formally communicate to the team that we wanted to be remote-first.

In practice, this meant:

- There was no expectation that teammates within commuting distance of our SF office needed to show up at the office on any given day.
- We were open to hiring remote teammates in non-engineering roles (and we soon hired some).
- Existing SF teammates could choose to move to a different location in the world if they wanted (and a few did).
- We stopped flying remote candidates to our SF office for interviews (many of them needed to be done via video chat anyway).

We did this because:

- It reflected the reality of the team and wasn't a big change.
- It was a huge benefit to our teammates to allow them to live anywhere they wanted and not have to commute. This is especially valuable for teammates with families.
- It gave teammates and candidates even more confidence that we were committed to maintaining good distributed team culture.

## All-remote

Near the end of 2019 we decided to become all-remote and get rid of our SF office entirely. As our team grew, we didn't want to create a growing SF office subculture at the company. We wanted to treat everyone equally and didn’t want our distributed teammates to feel second class. We knew that continuing to have an office as the team grew would be an increased risk to our remote-first culture, so we decided to go all-in.

Once this decision was made, there were a few logistical issues that we needed to figure out:

- Update our [benefits and perks](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/benefits-and-perks) so they make sense for an all-remote team (e.g., we removed our lunch benefit for SF teammates and added a benefit to pay for internet at home).
- Give everyone [a budget to set up their home office and/or work from a co-working space](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/spending-company-money) so everyone would have a productive place to work (as we discovered was important during our distributed days). Check out some of [our home offices](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/home-offices-of-sourcegraph)!
- Create [explicit travel budgets](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/people-ops/travel) so teammates can meet up regularly (we supported travel before this transition but the budgets weren't well defined).
- Update our [employee handbook](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook) to codify all of the [communication tactics](https://about.sourcegraph.com/handbook/communication) that we had learned as a remote-first team.
- List, show, and negotiate a sublease for our existing office space, and get a new minimal office address for mail and state and federal paperwork (we chose to get a desk at a coworking space near our old office).
- Pack up all of our stuff (office supplies, company swag, banners for events, furniture, art and wall accessories, spare electronic equipment and cables, food, and everything in between), and decide whether we should try to store it (and if so, where), sell it, or distribute it to team members.
- Update all of our financial and legal accounts, update contracts, and more.

## Tradeoffs

We love all-remote, but it doesn't work for everyone (just like working on an open-office plan doesn't work for everyone). Working remotely gives you extra freedom and flexibility, but also requires extra discipline and personal responsibility. Certain things that happen organically in an office environment (e.g., informal conversations at lunch), need to be explicitly planned (e.g., by scheduling small "watercooler" meetings with no agenda, or scheduling 1-1s between random teammates using a tool like donut.com).

We are committed to supporting all of our teammates to help them be successful. Check out our [tips for working remotely](https://about.sourcegraph.com/company/remote/tips).
